# Dice

## Logic

We store all the possible outcomes of throwing a dice (1 - 6) in a list. We use the `choice()` function from `random` module to choose a random object from this list.

`while` is a loop which keeps running the block of code inside it till the given condition evaluates to `False`. We use `while True` to make the loop infinite.

We ask the player if they want to play again after each throw. If they don't, we break out from the loop using `break`.

## Assignment

- Implement a "number of throws" system.
